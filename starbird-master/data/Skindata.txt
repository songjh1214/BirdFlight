Let's face the fact, nobody wants to be a normie. Nobody really. We all know being a normie 
sucks but what else can you do? Surely you can get a job, maybe some make some friends for a 
start but let's be honest, tackling such demanding tasks can be far from easy. 

Everyday you must fight in uphill battle to stay relevant in society but even then, what good 
does it do? Perhaps it's time to turn things around and to do that, tables are going to need 
to be flipped, and even for that you're going to need some strong hands.

The school's #1 flying ace, picking up gold in every competition he's been in there's little
wonder as to why the school's president has named him honour student of the year and has
his picture posted across campus using his distinguished rep as a sully way to raise the
school's enrollment. Rumours also has it that the school's comittee has proposed a vote to
ban him from all further competition in an attempt to level the playing field.

If you're tired of eating dust then look no further as Lightning McQueen got you covered but
as speed surely has it uses, it also has its limitation as you're going to need fast fingers
and a decent APM to survive and maintain your title as Red Baron.

The beast himself, boasting a 60% damage reduction it's no wonder they call him Big Puff
back in flight school. This guy always brings his lunch to school and never hesitates to
eat yours. We're talking about the guy who needs both doors open and takes up both seats
on the bus. Sounds familar to you, he's also the same guy that you'll likely never see hit
the gym. 

His years spent at the local internet cafe has got him lacking in the speed department, but
have no worries as his excessive calories quickly makes up for it because honestly, why need
speed when you got nothing to run from. So put aside your APM as you surely can't go 
wrong with this tanky beast and tell your buddies on hop on your back as you facetank the 
crap out of everything.

With those flamming new looks and super hot style, one can see this guy got all brand new
kicks for school. Some say he's so lit even his teachers call him Super Hot Fire while
other shrug it off in envy. But just saying, this dude leaves a fiery trial everywhere he 
goes and the girls are always hot on his tail.

Asisdes, everybody knows being a fiend can be a daunting task but this guy makes it look easy 
with his fiendish qualities making him your go-to-guy for sustained DPS and all around balanced 
stats. But off with a fair warning, will looking slick really help you survive what's to come?

Let's be honest here. Angry Birds is dead, nobody needs to say that twice, and it won't be 
coming back anytime soon.

We can all agree its glory days are long over. Now it stands nothing more than a reminiscence
of the old days. No longer can you find it trending on the App Store nor anywhere else really. 
I guess we all just have to face the fact that its time has long passed and it has been sent 
to the underworld of dead apps where it aimlessly lingers on with other souls such as Flappy 
Bird.

Plus, wasn't there an Angry Birds movie or something?

Ahh, who knows, and who cares!

LIFE. FORM. DISINTEGRATION. RAY.

Must they always flee?

I open my eye wide and unleash a beam of energy, following the escaping creatures. 
They are instantly reduced to ash. "Hmm. Void-native melting point is inconsistent," I note.

But that is of no consequence. The hunger inside me grows. I am ravenous. Insatiable, 
as never before.

I have glimpsed the ultimate knowledge.

And I will have it.

Let's hope you still got that mystery gift as you're going to need to go to Birth Island.
Oh and did I mention, you can't obtain that anymore. So wait, how did you get Deoxy then?
Surely nothing adds up here and the answer is fairly certain, you're probably just a 
big cheater. Sigh... stealing your mom's credit card to secretly purchase yourself some
GameShark and Action Replays.

You should definetly be ashamed of yourself really but nevertheless you got yourself one
of the strongest monsters in the game. So go ahead and pat yourself on the back, because
surely nobody's watching.

Ahh, those days of slowly climbing your way up Sky Pillar are finally over. It probably took
you numerous game saves and resets to obtain this bad boy but there's no doubt in your mind
it was totally worth it. 

The only thing left for you to do now is cruise through the lanes of easy street, dragon clawing
everything that stands between you and the hall of fame. It's no wonder Emerald was so damn 
easy.

Anyhow, lets hope you kept your master ball this time...
